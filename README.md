Code for benchmarking AutoGluon.

## Full AutoMLBenchmark

To run AutoMLBenchmark, see instructions in:

`examples/automlbenchmark/README_automlbenchmark.md`

Please note that these instructions are quite technical.

## Local Testing

To benchmark individual OpenML datasets, you can check out the examples in `examples/train_***`

The scripts are fairly primitive. They mimic what AutoMLBenchmark does contained to a single dataset.
